# Code Completion Analysis Report

## Overview
This report analyzes the performance of a code completion model tested on Python code samples, focusing on various audio and video processing functions.

## Metrics Results
- Average BLEU Score: 0.0242 (very low)
- Exact Match: 0.0000 (no perfect matches) 
- Average Levenshtein Distance: 866.5000 (high edit distance)
- Average CHRF: 22.0180 (low character-level similarity)

### Common Patterns in Predictions

#### Successful Predictions (from manual validation)
- Basic function signatures were generally predicted correctly
- Simple variable declarations and initializations
- Basic control flow structures

## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. Basic Structure Recognition
   - Model successfully recognized basic Python function patterns
   - Maintained consistent indentation
   - Preserved naming conventions

2. Context Understanding
   - Recognized the domain 
   - Maintained relevant variable names
   - Used appropriate library functions

### Weaknesses
1. Technical Accuracy
   - Very low BLEU score (0.0242) indicates poor technical accuracy
   - Zero exact matches suggest significant divergence from expected implementations
   - High Levenshtein distance (866.5) shows substantial differences in code structure

2. Implementation Details
   - Failed to properly implement complex algorithms
   - Missed important error checking
   - Incomplete function implementations

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Model Training
   - Include more domain-specific code examples
   - Focus on complete function implementations
   - Add more error handling patterns
   - Training should take into account target coding style

2. Context Window
   - Expand context window to capture more code relationships
   - Improve handling of library dependencies
   - Better recognition of function relationships

3. Code Quality
   - Implement better validation of generated code
   - Add syntax checking during generation
   - Improve consistency in code style

## Conclusion
The current model shows significant limitations in generating accurate code completions. 
The very low BLEU score and absence of exact matches indicate that the model requires substantial improvements in 
understanding and generating domain-specific code.

### Future Work
1. Collect more specialized training data
2. Implement better code validation
3. Focus on improving technical accuracy
4. Enhance context understanding
5. Develop better evaluation metrics for code generation
